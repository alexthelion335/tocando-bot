# Tocando Bot
This Discord bot, written in Node.js, is a very simple music bot. It can play any audio file or audio stream that can be accessed on the internet. If you want an easy way to play a file from one's computer, the file can be uploaded to Discord, and the link can be used to play it. It has no queue, and no YouTube support(though I plan to add both at some point in the future). 

## Commands
$help - displays a help message
<br>$about - gives an about message
<br>$play [url] - plays a song with url(only audio files are supported, no YouTube links)
<br>$stop - makes Tocando leave the channel

## Dependencies
This bot requires discord.js and YouTube-DL Core(even though support isn't added yet).
